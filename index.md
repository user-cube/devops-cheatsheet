1. **Error Reporting Template**:
If you encounter any bugs, glitches, or unexpected behavior within the project, please use the "Error Reporting" template. This template will guide you through providing essential details about the issue, such as the steps to reproduce it, the expected behavior, and any relevant error messages.

2. **Documentation Update Template**:
For issues related to outdated or inaccurate documentation, we encourage you to use the "Documentation Update" template. This template helps you articulate the specific changes required, ensuring a swift and precise update to our project's documentation. Your contributions to improving our documentation are highly valued.

3. **New Documentation Creation Template**:
Should you identify a need for new documentation or have insights on areas that lack proper documentation, please utilize the "New Documentation Creation" template. This template will guide you through proposing and creating new documentation, contributing to the project's overall comprehensiveness.
