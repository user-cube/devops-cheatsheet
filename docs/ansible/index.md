# Ansible

Ansible is an open-source automation tool that aims to simplify complex tasks such as configuration management, application deployment, and cloud provisioning. It provides a simple language to describe infrastructure and application deployment, making it easy to understand, share, and collaborate on automation. Ansible is agentless, meaning it doesn't require any additional software to be installed on the client systems, and it uses SSH for secure communication. With its extensive library of modules, Ansible can manage a wide variety of systems, including servers, network devices, and cloud resources. Its flexibility, scalability, and ease of use make it a popular choice for automating IT infrastructure and application workflows. Additionally, Ansible supports declarative configuration management, allowing users to define the desired state of their systems and applications, and automatically enforcing that state across the infrastructure. This approach simplifies the management of complex environments and promotes consistency and reliability in system configurations.
