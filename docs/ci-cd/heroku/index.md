# Heroku

Heroku is a cloud platform as a service (PaaS) that allows developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud. It supports several programming languages such as Java, Node.js, Scala, Clojure, Python, PHP, and Go.

## When to use Heroku?

Heroku is particularly useful when you want to deploy, run, and manage applications written in open language frameworks and technologies. It's ideal for rapid application development and prototyping. Here are some scenarios when you might want to use Heroku:

- You want to focus on writing code for your app, not managing servers.
- You need to quickly prototype a new feature or application.
- You want to use a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) workflow.
- You want to scale your application easily.

Remember, while Heroku is powerful and convenient, it might not be the best choice for all scenarios. For example, if you need full control over your servers and infrastructure, or if you're working on a project with specific compliance or regulatory requirements, you might want to consider other options.
